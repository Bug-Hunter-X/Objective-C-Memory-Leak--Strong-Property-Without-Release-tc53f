In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with memory management, specifically with regard to object ownership and the intricacies of retain counts.  Consider this scenario:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)someMethod {
    self.myString = [[NSString alloc] initWithString:@"Hello"];
    // ... some code ...
}
@end
```

The `strong` property attribute implies that `MyClass` retains `myString`.  If `someMethod` doesn't release `myString` before it returns, a memory leak occurs because no object owns the `NSString`. This is easily missed, especially in complex class structures.  Furthermore, relying solely on ARC (Automatic Reference Counting) can mask such issues until they manifest as memory leaks or crashes.
